Gautam Gupta,"Prior to TCV (www.tcv.com), I was founder/CEO of NatureBox (www.naturebox.com), a digitally native brand of snacks. The company has attracted millions of customers and has over 40% brand awareness across the country. We achieved a lot but had our fair share of bumps. This experience gave me many hard-earned lessons in management, Pre-series, raising capital, and dealing with “shit-hit-the-fan” moments. I started my career as an early stage investor at General Catalyst. I had the great fortune to join the firm when I was 18 years old and spent the first 8 years of my career as part of the team that scaled it from a small firm to one with global reach. I helped open the west coast office. As a professional and angel investor, I have funded 30+ companies. This portfolio generates close to $2B in annual net revenue. Examples include BigCommerce, GoodData, Honest Company, Grammarly, Imperfect Produce, Pilot, The Pill Club, Heap Analytics, Split.io, among others.",United States,US/Canada,series++,Multi-stage VC,10000000,10000000,Sector Agnostic,
